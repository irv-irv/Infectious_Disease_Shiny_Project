## Infectious Disease Model

#### Purpose
Our program will allow the user to simulate what occurs via an infectious disease model. The user will be able to control three variables that all play a factor in the infectious disease model. These three variables are susceptibility, infection, and recovery. The user will be able to change these variables by moving sliders on a website that will then correspond to a graph that shows what is happening in the disease model as the parameters are being changed.

#### Do I have to install any programs?
The programmer will need R, the shiny package in R, and an internet connection to view the website that will contain the output of your program.

#### Example of how to use the program
